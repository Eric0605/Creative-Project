   <h1>Gatsby Background</h1>
   <p>Gatsby came from a lower class familiyin the Midwest</p>
   <p>He falls in love in Dasiy before he was called to war. Being just a soldier, he has no money and power</p>
   <p>He is not a honest marchant as his money comes from the illegal business with alcohol, yet he is a sincere person and treats his love toward Dasiy as true</p>

   <h1>Gatsby's American Dream</h1>
   <p>There is no doubt that Gatsby's dream is to earn Dasiy's love</p>
   <p>Coming from a lower class, his dream suits the orginal defination of the American Dream the most</p>
   <p>Yet the reality destroyed his dream curely. Dasiy married Tom during the time of War. The social difference between Gatsby and dasiy is never truely overcome</p>
   <p>Gatsby takes on the blame for Dasiy manslaughter and paid his life for it.</p>
   <p>His dream is never sucessful and is crashed with the death of himself</p>
   <p>The lack of people going to his funeral and the run away of Dasiy and Tom also shows the emptyness of his dream</p>

   Supporting Quotes
   </h4>
   <p>However, glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders (Fitzgerald 149)</p>
   <p>He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drug-stores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That's one of his little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn't far wrong (Fitzgerald 133)</p>
