      Supporting Quotes
      </h4>
      <p>“Instead of being the warm center of the universe---so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man”  (Fitzgerald 5) </p>
      <p>“I couldn't forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy---they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made…” (Fitzgerald 179) </p>
