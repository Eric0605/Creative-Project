      <h1>Daisy background</h1>
      <image src= "../images/Money.jpg" alt="Money" style="display:inline; float: right; weight: 200px; height: 200px;">
      <p>She is a wealthy upper class woman. She loves money a lot</p>
      <p>She is morally weak, unwilling to take responsiblity. The nature of her is not evil but can fall into evil easily</p>
      <h1>Daisy's American Dream</h1>
      <p>Dasiy believe that money and prestige can lead to happiness the most. That is basically the reason why she rather pick Tom as her husband rather than Gastby</p>

      <h1>Dasiy as the representation of the American Dream</h1>
      <image src= "../images/longPath.jpg" alt="Path" style="display:inline; float: left; weight: 190px; height: 190px;">
      <p>The nature of the American Dream is not evil, but people would do evil in order to get her, like Gastby running illegal business</p>
      <p>People would not treasure the dream after they achieve it, like Tom having mistress</p>
      <p>The American Dream may be a fantasy to some as the closer someone get to the dream, the more impossible the dream is, like the failure for Gastby to gain Dasiy back</p>

      Supporting Quotes
      </h4>
      <p>"Her voice is full of money," he said suddenly. That was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money--that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it. . . . High in a white palace the king's daughter, the golden girl. . . . (Fitzgerald 120) </p>
